write Ruby on Rails code which will show the list of the entered values as a table in which the first column prints the username and the second column 
shows the user skin color name. 
On the same page there is a "ADD" button which, when pressed, will open a modal window with a text input for entering the username
and a drop-down menu  for selecting the user skin color. 
Once the user press the "Submit" button the username and the skin color are saved into a sql database, the modal windows closes, 
and the page will get updated with the new entered values showing on top of the list.
