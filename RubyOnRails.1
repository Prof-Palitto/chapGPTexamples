write Ruby on Rails code which will present a text input and a drop-down menu for entering the user name and selecting the user skin color. Once the user press the button "Submit" the name and the skin color are saved into a sql database. The page will show the list of the entered values as a table in which the first column prints the name and the second column shows the color name.
As an example, if user enters "matteo" in the textbox and selects brown the page will show:

matto     BROWN
davide     WHITE
other-User skin-color
